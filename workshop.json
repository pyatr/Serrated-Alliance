  "Title": "Serrated Alliance (Weapons & Attachments)",
  "Description": "Features:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]13 new weapons many of which require new, less common than a lead slug, ammo types - pistols, rifles, machineguns, anti-armor weapons.\r\n[*]New sounds and tiles for several existing weapons.\r\n[*]Weapon attachment system - sights, underbarrel weapons, bayonets, muzzle devices and other items each making your gun a little more powerful. Some attachments are integral to weapons. Existing weapons also have attachment slots.\r\n[*]Semi-automatic mode for most automatic weapons which slightly increases weapon accuracy.\r\n[*]Prone position for your character which slightly increases accuracy, even moreso with bipods, and increases your DV against ranged attacks from 5+ tiles.\r\n[*]Smoke grenades which obscure enemy sight.\r\n[*]Phosphorus grenades which inflict acid and heat damage.\r\n[*]New magazine size upgrades - high capacity and drum loaded magazines. Some weapons can have only one or neither.\r\n[/list]\r\n\nAll items can be found around the world and at gunsmiths. Legendary gunsmiths have curious devices in particular.\r\nThanks to Ydrials for helping make title picture.\r\nReport issues in comments or on Discord pyatr#3636.
